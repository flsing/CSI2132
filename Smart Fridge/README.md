The data and code here is out of date and will most likely not work. 

Term project to be completed by myself and Patrick Langis. It is still a work in progress. 
 
 We used a bootstrap template in order to create the webpage. 
 
 We used Flask and Python in order to connect to our database that was created in Postgresql.
